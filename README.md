A simple website designed to calculate the loan one has to pay based on initial principle, time duration, and an interest rate which is added in a compound manner.

Steps to preview the website:
1. Download the extension "Live server" on VS code (or similar if you're using some other text editor to open the code)
2. Put these 3 files in a single folder and open that folder in VS code
3. Right-click in index.html and select the option "Open with Live Server"
4. You should now see the live preview of the website.

Here you can input the values in "Amount", "Interest Rate", and " Months" field to define the initial principle, Interest rate (which will be compounded anually)
and the time duration to pay the loan.
